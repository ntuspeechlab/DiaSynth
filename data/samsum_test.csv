Oliver: and second, you only get the income for the resources you own (tokens on top) and not for everything you have access to
Chris: the map had full symbol drawn for the action so I also thought it was permanent influence
Chris: had no idea about the second one
Emily: the second rule means money would be much more sparse
Oliver: well yes but it gives you a reason to build an already existing building again
Oliver: with the rules we played with there was no sense in doing that
Emily: true
Emily: yet another game we need to play again with the right rules ;)
Oliver: additionally during the vote phase, if there is a draw the first decision is taken by the player with the least amount of points and not the closest to the player initiating the vote
Chris: makes sense
Chris: but I'm not sure about the income phase, it's written that you get income for import
Olivier: well yes but technically the import action is building your own buildings
Oliver: so no matter how you look at it with import you'll always be on top with your token and get the income
Chris: right
Chris: well just like Emily said we need to play this again
Emily: we can always do it during the next meeting

Ron: I might be lacking the context here
Michaela: Basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association, so it's easier to get funds for events for example
Jessie: I'm torn actually - I get why it would help with funds, cooperation with other institutions and such, but I researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork.
Steve: And someone to take care of it permanently, cause it doesn't end at setting up the association - you have to do it every year.
Michaela: These are exactly the kind of things that I wanted to discuss with you. Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? Doesn't have to be one person.
Steve: Frankly, I don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility
Ron: The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? There are also some financial costs, are there?
Michaela: yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really.
Jessie: so what do we get from it really?
Michaela: maybe the cost of a rubber stamp.
Michaela: for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association <file_other>
Ron: and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association
Jessie: I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually
Michaela: I recall two as well
Steve: but do we truly need those subsidies? We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort.
Steve: I'm just afraid we're gonna lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gonna turn into a business and will create tensions between us. I've seen it happen to clubs like ours
Ron: it's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding
Michaela: association is not a business, we're not gonna start selling things. It's just about access to the possibilities that's we're denied right now cause we're not a formal association
Jessie: well... I could help out with the paperwork, but not alone. I'd say 2 more people would be enough to make this work
Michaela: as this was my idea, I can help too, just a matter of dividing our work properly
Ron: I can't take up additional responsibilities right now with all that's been going on, so I won't be able to help, buy if y'all agree it's a good idea, I'm going to support it
Michaela: Steve?
Steve: I don't know man, I like things the way they are right now

Luisa: Oh well... Wait and see. The last prospective buyers we had, 5 weeks back, were so enthusiastic we'd thought we're done. They said ours was shortlisted, their favourite in Ballito, but they still wanted to check another estate. And that was it. She didn't even bother to phone, just sent me a minimal message. Bill got so frustrated that he drank himself stiff that night.
Leu: He does it from time to time, doesn't he?
Luisa: From time to time? Regularly!!! Can't you remember?!
Leu: Not quite. Never saw him really tight.
Luisa: Cause you used to leave before his evening was over. I'm seriously worried about his health, to tell you the truth. It's just every day that he tipples.
Leu: As if slowly killing himself with liquor.
Luisa: He doesn't care. He says he's got his life behind him.
Leu: But it is terrible. How can you cope with it?
Luisa: I stopped to care too. It is his life. If he wants to put a quicker end to it, it's up to him. Look I cannot do anything about it. What hide bottles? Just don't want to have an invalid in my house one day.
Leu: Therapy?
Luisa: Gimme a break! Can you imagine Bill attending an AA therapy like a good boy! I can't.
Leu: Nor can I.
Luisa: We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago. When he started, just after and because of his early retirement, I thought I'd better refrain from commenting because he's so depressed. But then it was worse and worse... Now it's too late.
Leu: Poor Luisa, poor Bill. It is so sad. But you are tough Luisa. You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, I'd say.
Luisa: Yes, I am. That keeps me sane. I don't worry if I can't change it. To a degree...
Leu: Right you are! ""The beach scape changes every month as tides bring in tons of sand and cover the rocks making the beach appear totally different."" Do you remember?
Luisa: ""Then the rocks are laid bare as the tide pulls away the sand. Such is life.""",Luisa has had no luck selling her house yet. It took Leu 2 year to sell his apartment. Bill has a drinking problem. Luisa has stopped trying to help Bill. ,695

734,"Max: Din anyone actually watch this the video? 
Max: <link_video>
Allen: Research shows that long term cannabis use ( via smoke inhalation ) produces NO noticeable long term consequences - whereas tobacco use leads to COPD ect. But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases.
Jeremy: Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an ""occasional low cumulative"", which could be something like smoking once or twice a month.
Max: Tom You didn’t watch the video.
Tom: I was just about to complain, then i saw your post. Thanks. ;)
Jason: I like how he doesn't mention the fact that most people smoking spliffs will probably be using tobacco in them as well pretty much everybody I know who smokes weed put tobacco in them and they smoke cigarettes as well.
Daniel: Short attention span 😊
Max: Daniel probably from pot 🤷‍♂️
Max: Jason he does - rewatch the end man. He doesn’t specifically say combing the two , but he says one usually precedes the other. 
David: Jason, I used to smoke baccy avec hashish but no longer, and I know only one person out of billions who still smokes weed with tobacco.
Rawiri: Jason Hollis yuck...why even???
Tom: I know that a joint is bigger than a roach, so is a spliff bigger than a joint?
David: I don’t believe there is a size relationship between names of roll-ups (except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll-up). I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. Some spliffs may be big some joints be small...
Ken: Allen So quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues.
Tom: BTW Seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, I'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. Propaganda. Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine
Brian: this is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis. It's not saying cannabis is harmful... there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates.
Ken: Really? Putting smoke in your lungs is bad for your respiratory system.....shocker. oil....edibles...many ways to enjoy and get relief from chronic pain and or what ever you need to get on with it.
Mark: Cannabis does not have a bad affect on the lungs!!
Virginia: MJ users will not believe anything bad. They think it is right up there with kale and swiss chard!",Max and his friends watched the video about cannabis. Allen believes that long term use has no consequences according to the research. Jeremy explains it wasn't long term use but rather an occasional use. Mark reckons they don't affect the lungs.

Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?

1110,"Nancy: Yeah, but u can also read the news online ;)
Phil: I know, but imagine - ur keen on technology and u get all the news in one place. Then u can choose what to read and what not.
Nancy: Sounds sensible. Does it have something 4 fashion?
Phil: Probably so. Not sure, though.
Nancy: How about u, Vic?
Vic: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.
Phil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. 
Vic: What do u mean?
Phil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u.
Vic: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters.
Phil: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook.
Nancy: So no one uses 4 example Instagram?
Vic: I do. 
Phil: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online. 
Nancy: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram.
Phil: I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast. 
Vic: That's not all ppl post on Instagram!
Phil: So, what else?
Vic: Depends on ur interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :)
Phil: And does this motivate u to train?
Vic: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. 
Nancy: What do u think about Tumblr?
Phil: What?
Vic: Heard about it, but never had an account.
Nancy: It's a microblogging website. U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. And ppl can observe u!
Phil: Don't have that much time to write a blog.
Vic: Me neither. 
Phil: Nancy, y do u ask these questions? ;)

Sophie: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you?
Noah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of ""family care"" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.
Sophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!
Noah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.

Noah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.

1513,"Andy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.
Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? 
Andy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.
Betty: Why is that?
Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.
Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?
Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.
Betty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?
Andy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.
Betty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?
Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  
Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?
Andy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  
Betty: So what would you recommend?
Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. 
Betty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? 
Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.
Betty: OK, is this something your company can help with?
Andy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. 
Betty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?
Andy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday.

Sean: Nick needs to really think about rolling with Blake. John needs a QB!

Charles: I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much
Karen: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better
Monica: I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I'm much better now
Jack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?
Monica: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens
Charles: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare
Karen: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?
Charles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet
Karen: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm
Monica: You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat
